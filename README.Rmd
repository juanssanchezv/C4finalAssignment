# Readme
This is the readme for the final assignment of the coursera course  'Getting and Cleaning Data' made in r and is about the experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

# Codebook
CodeBook.md  is a file that describes the variables, the data, and any changes or work that I made to clean up the data

# r Script
run_analysis.R is the script that makes the new clean dataset following the review criteria of the assignment:
* The submitted data set is tidy.
* The Github repo contains the required scripts.
* GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
* The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
* The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.

# NewDataset.txt
NewDataset.txt is the final file made after running the script described above.
