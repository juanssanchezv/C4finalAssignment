## Code Book

This is a Code Book document. It indicates all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

## Set the work directory, download the dataset and unzip it

First I set the directory so the dataset is download in the right place, then the file is unzipped

## Read the files and make them variables
The txt's files from the unzipped file are:
* features is a table with all the names of the variables of the dataset, the size is 561x2
* activity_labels is a table with all the activities performed by the people, the size is 6x2
* subject_test is a table  of the data for the 30% of the people, the size is 2947x1
* x_test is a table of the features data for the 30% of the people, the size is 2947x561
* y_test is a table of the activities labels data for the 30% of the people, the size is 2947x1
* subject_train is a table  of the data for the 70% of the people, the size is 7352x1
* x_train is a table of the features data for the 70% of the people, the size is 7352x561
* y_train is a table of the activities labels data for the 70% of the people, the size is 7352x1

## Join the data

The data was join i the following way:
* subject_test and subject_train where joined with the "rbind" function
* x_test and x_train where joined with the "rbind" function
* y_test and y_train where joined with the "rbind" function
* The three data tables from above where joined with the "cbind" function

## Clean the data
The joined dataset was cleaned by creating a new dataset and selecting the following columns:
* subject column which comes from joining the subject_test and subject_train tables
* num column which comes from joining the y_test and y_train tables
* all the columns which have 'mean' and 'std' in their label which comes from joining the x_test and x_train tables
Then the column label 'subject' was changed to 'Person' for better understanding
Then the column 'num' was changed to 'Activity' for better understanding
Finally the abreviations of words were replaced with the full words instead for example:
* "Acc" to "Accelerometer", "gravity" to "Gravity", "Gyro" to "Gyroscope", "BodyBody" to "Body", "Mag" to "Magnitude", "^t" to "Time ", "^f" to "Frequency ", "angle" to "Angle "

## Create a new file with the clean data and summarized it
Finally the data is grouped by Person and Activity, then the mean of all the other variables is calculated and at last the new dataset which is a table of size 180x88 is saved in a txt file
